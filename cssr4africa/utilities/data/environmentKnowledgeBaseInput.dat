preGestureMessageEnglish      6 Access to the internet is the gateway to digital services. In the Connectivity section, Upanzi showcases projects aimed at expanding and measuring internet access in Africa, especially in underserved rural regions. Currently, a deep urban-rural digital divide persists: in Africa, about 57% of urban dwellers use the Internet, compared to just 23% of people in rural areas​. Upanzi’s projects tackle this gap from multiple angles – by piloting innovative connectivity solutions, monitoring internet resilience, and promoting open data for informed policy

As Africa’s digital ecosystem grows (with e-government services, mobile apps, and AI technologies), ensuring their security and integrity is paramount. Upanzi researchers are working on multiple fronts: security testing of e-services and mobile apps, innovative defenses against AI-driven threats like deepfake voices, and studying emerging attack vectors such as smishing (SMS phishing)

Upanzi’s Capacity Building initiatives focus on empowering individuals – students, researchers, policymakers and implementers  with the skills, knowledge, and ethical frameworks to drive and sustain digital innovation. In this final section of the tour, you will learn about several programs: our annual Digital Identity Hackathon and picoCTF Africa, the use of AI for Policy Analysis, our efforts in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), and the aforementioned Data Quality Measurement project. These initiatives ensure that the digital public goods we develop are used effectively and responsibly, and that a pipeline of talent and ideas continues to grow. The format here is part showcase, part dialogue – you’ll meet an Innovation Coach

preGestureMessageEnglish      9 Thank you for joining us today and accepting to play the role of citizen protagonist. Overall, the tour painted a comprehensive picture of the Upanzi Network’s approach: building interoperable Digital Public Infrastructure that is open-source and scalable, while simultaneously investing in the governance, security, and capacity required to make that infrastructure impactful. You have seen how a citizen’s single digital identity threads through various services – a powerful illustration of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. By the end of this immersive experience, it’s evident that digital public goods do not stand alone; they interlock like pieces of a puzzle, supported by robust connectivity and safeguarded by vigilant cybersecurity measures, all driven forward by skilled and conscientious individuals.
